//Deploying to a testnet
Make sure you have a metamask or other wallet, and export the private key.

IMPORTANT

USE A METAMASK THAT DOESNT HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS IN IT. Just in case you accidentally push your private key to a public place. I highly recommend you use a different metamask or wallet when developing.

Export your private key and place it in your .env file, as done above.

Go to Alchemy and create a new project on the testnet of choice (ie, Sepolia)

Grab your URL associated with the testnet, and place it into your .env file.

Make sure you have testnet ETH in your account. You can get some here. You should get testnet ETH for the same testnet that you made a project in Alchemy (ie, Sepolia)

Run node deploy.js
